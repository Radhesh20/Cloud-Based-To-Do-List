> **Live Demo**: [View Live](https://radhesh20.github.io/Cloud-Based-To-Do-List/) 

This is a **cloud-integrated to-do list application** where users can create, update, delete tasks, and organize them into projects.  
Unlike traditional to-do apps using only `localStorage`, this app is built with future cloud storage integration in mind — making your data accessible from anywhere.
